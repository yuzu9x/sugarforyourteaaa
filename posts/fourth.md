## 1. Experimenting
Before getting started, I needed to check the durability of using PVA glue as an adhesive for the sugar cubes.

## 2. Building
Using cut styrofoam as a base (shoutout my dad), I started building onto the base using sugar cubes. I first made a few components separate from the base, so that they could dry and I can add them to my setting. Then I start building directly onto the base, so it would be sturdier. I added led lights and tried to hide them the best I could.

## 3. Final Touches
With the help of Katelyn, Daisy, and Claire, they quickly 3d printed mini pickaxes, minecarts, and ladders for me to use in my diorama! I made a few little sugar cube people, equipped them with arms and tools, and set them in their world. Finally, I sprinkled sugar all over the village so the ground would be almost like a sand or snow.
