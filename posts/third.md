## Concept Statement:

In the year 8000, the world faces a quiet biological awakening as sugar, once nothing more than sweetness and grain, gains sentience through patient bacterial evolution. 
<br>
My project imagines a future where the simple sugar becomes an architect of a miniature-civilization. 
The sugar cube people mine the very substance that shapes their bodies, buildings, and futures. 
This awakening reshapes how sugar is a commodity in human imports and exports, as they now deal business directly with Sugar itself.
 <br>
My diorama depicts a miniature scale of Sugar’s monopoly on sugar.
Through sugar, I explore how invisible systems of desire + greed unfold into new, harmful behaviors, as sweetness becomes a kind of hunger, and hunger becomes a quiet ruler. 
The audience will explore a diorama made entirely from sugar, built to evoke wonder tinged with unease and to invite reflection on how every civilization begins with a source it both cherishes and slowly destroys.


### Due to mining sugar not being a replenishable resource in their world, the sugar people have resorted to sacrificing a portion of their population to sustain their needs.

## Sugar is a Mirror of Our Own Behaviors
# Sugar = Money
