# Emerging Futures
Hello everyone, 
Here, I will be explaining my initial though process for the conception stage of my final assignment. 
<br>
When initially thinking about the premise of an emerging future, I couldn't pull myself away from envisioning a mini-civilization. I've consumed lots of media and obviously experienced many things in real life to know that patterns and habits can easily form in a growing society. 
<br>
I tried to tie this assignment to something mundane that I encounter on the daily, as well as many others. At the time this project was assigned, I was really into eating raw sugarcane and drinking sugarcane juice. From there, I had the idea to build a miniature town using sugar, humanizing the non-sentient ingredient. 
<br> That what if one day impossibly into the future, sugar were a living breathing organism, and has gained monopoly over their own people as export? 
<br>
Sugar would be used to build homes, tools, and makes up the population itself. Without the sugar, there would be nothing! In order to maintain a living and working village, sugar needs to be harvested and "used".
