## Human Behavior v.s. Ant Behavior
i think we’ve all seen (especially recently) that the people who contribute most to our society are often underappreciated. employees in large companies are not greatly valued, however the company cannot function in their absence. there seems to be a common pattern in ignoring these essential components of our vast system.
<br>
it seems that humans are most often motivated by their greed and hunger for power. when comparing a similar heirarchy to a species like ants, in contrast, we see a functional, mutually beneficial, and non-exploitative system.
<br>
the ants are all working together to keep each other alive by gathering food + protection, whereas the humans are working in favor of themselves.
 <br>
my question is: how would sugar function as a civilization, and what for? since they rely on the work and sacrificial deaths of one another to sustain their own economy?
